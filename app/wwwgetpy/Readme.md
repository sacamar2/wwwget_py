This is a module done because of need.

Take into account that you will be able to use only if:
- Your OS is Windows
- WSL is working on your system

This module downloads a HTTP folder system. It downloads each file copying the structure. It is similar to wget but:
- It is done in paralel
- It doesn't create weird artifacts
